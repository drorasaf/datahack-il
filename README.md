# datahack-il
This code was created as part of DataHack 2015.
The code tries to find correlations between Stack Overflow posts and GitHub repositories.
It uses Google cloud service in order to query GitHub, and a downloaded version of stack overflow posts. 

Several applications:
1. Is there correlation between github and stack overflow?
2. Are code snippets in stack overflow are copied to github or code that exists in github
   repositories are used as answers in stack overflow posts?
